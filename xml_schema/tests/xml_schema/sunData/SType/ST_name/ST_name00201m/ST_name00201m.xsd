    strategy:  Define type with name 'nsk:Test' that is a restriction of 
               the type 'string' with the pattern '1|2|3'.
               Then declare an element with name 'test' of
               the type 'nsk:Test'.
               This is an invalid schema because the ':' is not allowed by
               NCName.
