Because
JavaTest and the JavaTest Agent run on different
systems, values such as path names and variable names
may differ on each system.  For example, if a file
is accessed over a network, it might be mounted as
<code>/home/tests/lib</code> on the JavaTest system and as
<code>F:\tests\lib</code> on the system running the
JavaTest Agent.
<p>
The map file is used to associate values used on the
JavaTest Agent with those used by JavaTest.  The map file
is specified on the JavaTest Agent, but the use of the map
must be enabled here. 
<p>
For example, these are map file entries when you pass the interview on 
Solaris but run the Agent on Windows:
<br>
# mapping for TCK directory:
<br><code>/usr/local/home/jaxb/jaxb_tck c:\jaxb\jaxb_tck</code>
<br>
# mapping for working directory:
<br><code>/usr/local/home/jaxb/tck/work h:\jaxb\tck\work</code>
<p>
For more information about map files, refer to the <em>JavaTest
User's Guide</em> or to the <em>JAXB TCK User's Guide</em>.
