Answer <b>"Yes"</b> to instruct JavaTest to start a separate process every time a new schema is compiled/generated or a new test is executed.
In this case, the schema compiler, the schema generator and all tests will work in the so-called <b>"multiJVM"</b> mode.
<p>
Answer <b>"No"</b> to compile/generate all schemas and execute all tests in a single process, the Agent's JVM. 
In this case, the schema compiler, the schema generator and all tests will work in the so-called <b>"singleJVM"</b> mode.
<p>
For more information about test run modes, refer to the <em>JavaTest User's Guide<em> and to the <em>JAXB TCK User's Guide<em>.
