The JavaTest Agent can run in <em>active</em> or
<em>passive</em> mode:
<table width="100%" border=0 cellpadding=0>
<!-- formatting table -->
<tr valign="top">
<td width="70">
Passive
</td>
<td>
JavaTest initiates connections to a passive agent as
needed.  Passive agents are slightly simpler, but less
flexible because they require you to specify the test
machine as part of the test configuration, not at the
time you run the tests. Passive agents do not allow
you to run tests in parallel.
<br>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Active
</td>
<td>
Active agents initiate connections to JavaTest as available.
Active agents allow you to run tests in parallel using many
agents at once. Active agents allow you to specify the
test machines at the time you run the tests.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Unless your decision is dictated by security restrictions
on your platform, active agents are recommended.

User's Guide</em> or to the JavaTest online help.
