The <em>tools</em> package provides the interfaces that represent <b><em>Tool Shell</em></b> classes and contracts.
The <em>Tool Shells</em> are specified with different sub-classes to facilitate handling common processors (such as parsers
and emitters) and the tasks that they support.
<p>
The <em>tools</em> package also specifies interface contracts such as 
<em>ArgHandler</em> for decoding and handling arguments.
